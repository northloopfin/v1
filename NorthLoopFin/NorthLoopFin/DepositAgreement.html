<p><b> 2. DEPOSIT ACCOUNT BASICS</b>.</p>
<p><u>Who is Eligible for an Account </u></p>
<p>The Account is available to consumers who are citizens or permanent residents of the fifty United States (&ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;) and the District of Columbia who are at least 18 years of age with a valid Social Security number or Tax Identification Number. You must agree to accept electronic, rather than paper statements. Your acceptance of electronic statements means; (i) you must keep us supplied with your valid email address; and (ii) you must agree to accept electronic delivery of all account communications (such as end-of-year tax forms and electronic statements).</p>
<p>We may use information from third parties to help us determine if we should open your Account.</p>
<p><u>Opening an Account </u></p>
<p><b>Important information about procedures for opening a new Account</b></p>
<p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an Account. What this means for you: When you open an Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see a copy of your driver's license or other identifying documents.</p>
<p><u>The Account </u></p>
<p>The Account consists of the non-interest-bearing online demand deposit account used to hold your deposits and make payments and transfers to and from the Account. If made available by Platform, the Account may include the use of a Debit Card to make payments and transfers to third parties. Use of a Debit Card will be subject to additional terms and conditions contained in a Cardholder Agreement.</p>
<p><u>Titling and Ownership</u></p>
<p>An Account may only be owned and titled in the name of one (1) person who shall solely retain the right to direct the deposit or transfer of funds. The Account cannot be owned or titled jointly, by an organization, as Payable on Death (<b>"POD"</b>) or "In Trust For" (<b>"ITF"</b>).</p>
<p><u>Death or Incapacitation </u></p>
<p>You or your appointed party, designee, or appointed individual agree to notify us promptly if you become legally incapacitated, are deemed incompetent, or die. We will continue to accept deposits and process transaction instructions into and from your Account until we are: (a) notified of your death or adjudication of incompetency and (b) have a reasonable opportunity to act. You agree that, even if we have knowledge of your death we may pay or process transactions on your Account on or before the date of death for up to ten (10) days after that date unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming interest in the Account. We may require additional documentation to confirm any claims made on the Account.</p>
<p><u>Power of Attorney</u></p>
<p>We may but are not required to, honor your orders and instructions to give another person authority to make transactions on your Account by giving power of attorney to another individual. The account owner and person executing power of attorney over a deposit account is known as the "Principal." The person granted Power of Attorney for the Principal is known as the "Agent." We may refuse to accept a power of attorney for reasonable cause, and we may require the Agent to sign an affidavit stating that the power of attorney presented to us is a true copy and that, to the best of the Agent's knowledge, the Principal continues to be alive and competent and that the relevant powers of the Agent have not been amended or terminated. The Principal is responsible to provide us with any information if an affidavit presented to us is untrue or misleading or if the Agent exceeds the authority granted by the Principal in the power of attorney. The Agent is required to notify us in writing if the Principal dies or is declared incompetent. The power of attorney will continue in force until a) we receive written revocation from the Principal; b) we receive written notification of the Principal's death, or c) we receive written notification of the death or incapacity of the Agent.</p>
<p><u>Our Relationship With You </u></p>
<p>This Agreement and the deposit relationship do not create a fiduciary relationship with Bank..</p>
<p>
  <b>3. GENERAL RULES GOVERNING THE ACCOUNT</b>
	<p>
      The Account and your obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned. We may transfer our rights under this Agreement. Use of the Account is subject to all applicable rules and customs of any clearinghouse or other association involved in transactions. We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at any time. There are restrictions imposed on your Account that may limit your ability to use your Account. Some restrictions, which are designed to detect and prevent unauthorized use of your Account, cannot be disclosed. There are also transactional (“frequency or dollar”) limits imposed on your Account. The transactional limits provided in the table(s) below are the lowest limits allowed and we will not decrease these limits without prior notice. However, we reserve the right to allow you to transact higher volume than the limits defined herein at any time without prior notice. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any governmental agency, local, state, or federal, the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall not be affected. This Agreement will be governed by the law of the State of Tennessee except to the extent governed by federal law.
