<ol>
<li><strong> IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT USING YOUR ACCOUNT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who obtains a Card. What this means for you: when you register a Card, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, social security number or tax identification number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see a copy of your driver&rsquo;s license or other identifying documents.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>USE OF YOUR CARD</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each transaction on your Card is subject to the terms of your Deposit Account Agreement. To protect the use of your Card, you will be provided with a personal identification number (&ldquo;</span><strong>PIN</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;), which must be used on all automated teller machine (&ldquo;</span><strong>ATM</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) transactions and PIN transactions. You should not disclose your PIN to anyone. If the security or confidentiality of your PIN is compromised, you should notify us at once by calling us at +1 (415) 993-4301 or by emailing us at help@synapsefi.com. Your Card will allow you to conduct:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATM Transactions: Your Card may be used with a PIN at any ATM connected to one of the various card processing networks in which we participate (&ldquo;</span><strong>Networks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) to make cash withdrawals directly from your Account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PIN Transactions: Your Card may be used with a PIN to access funds in your Account to purchase goods or services and to obtain cash at any merchant that participates in the Networks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Transactions: Your Card also may be used without a PIN to access funds in your Account to purchase goods or services at any merchant that accepts Visa debit cards, and to make cash withdrawals from the tellers at those banks and other financial institutions that participate in the Visa Network and accept Visa debit cards.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PIN Transactions and Visa transactions are accepted solely at the option of individual business establishments, banks and other financial institutions, and you agree that we will not be liable to you for refusal by any such business, bank or financial institution to honor the Card.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> PREAUTHORIZED RECURRING TRANSFERS; STOPPING PAYMENT ON TRANSACTIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use your Card or the account number for your Card to authorize in advance any recurring payments from your Deposit Account (for example, a monthly gym membership fee) and later wish to stop one or more of these payments, you should contact the merchant/biller directly. If the merchant/biller fails to stop the recurring payments, contact us at +1 (415) 993-4301 or send a support message via the Website. If you wish us to stop a particular payment, you must notify us as provided in the agreement for the Deposit Account from which this payment is made in time for us to receive your request three (3) business days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you deliver your stop payment request by telephone you must confirm your stop payment order in writing within 21 days of your oral stop payment order. An oral stop payment request will not be binding on us after 21 days if you fail to provide the required written confirmation (which can be in the form of a support message submitted via the Website). Your Card may have to be cancelled in order to stop recurring payments. </span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> HOLDS FOR AUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>We may place a hold on your Deposit Account for a Card transaction.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you use your Card for certain transactions (including every PIN and many Visa transactions), the merchant accepting your Card may request advance authorization of that transaction. If we authorize a transaction, we may place a temporary &ldquo;hold&rdquo; on your Deposit Account for the amount of the authorized transaction, which we refer to as a &ldquo;POS hold.&rdquo; A POS hold is not payment for an authorized transaction. We will make payment for a transaction only after the actual transaction is presented to us physically or electronically.</span></p>
<p><strong>Release of POS holds.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Any POS hold on your Deposit Account will be released upon the earlier of: (a) the day we: (i) receive the actual transaction, (ii) post that transaction to your Account for payment, and (iii) match the authorization of that transaction to the actual transaction; or (b) three (3) business days after the date we authorized that transaction. The release of the POS hold will be in the form of a credit to your Deposit Account for the amount of the hold. Credits for released POS holds and payments for Card transactions are posted separately to your Account, and the credit for any particular POS hold is not used to pay the particular transaction for which the hold was placed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Effect of an authorization hold. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each POS hold will reduce the available balance in your Deposit Account by the amount of the hold. In the event the available balance in your Deposit Account is insufficient to pay items posted to your Account, transactions will decline.</span></p>
<p><strong>Authorization requests by merchants.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Under the Visa rules governing Card transactions, merchants generally are permitted to request authorization only for the actual amount of a transaction. However, certain kinds of merchants in specified situations are permitted to request authorization for a Card transaction in an amount different from the amount of the actual transaction. For example, restaurants and drinking establishments may request authorization for the estimated amount of a transaction, and others may request authorization for an amount up to 20% over the amount of the actual bill in order to cover an anticipated tip. When we receive an authorization request from a merchant, we do not receive information from which to determine whether the request covers the actual amount of a transaction, an estimated amount, or whether the merchant&rsquo;s request exceeds the amount permitted by the Visa rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use your Card to pay for a $50 dinner, the restaurant may request authorization for a $60 transaction, as permitted by the Visa rules.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use your Card at a drinking establishment to order drinks totaling $10, the establishment might request authorization for a $50 transaction in anticipation that you will place additional orders. Even though this practice may not be permitted by the Visa rules, we cannot make this determination at the time we receive the authorization request.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card terminals used for &ldquo;pay at the pump&rdquo; gasoline purchases will check for authorization before the amount of any purchase is determined. Authorization will be given only if the available balance in your Deposit Account equals or exceeds a certain designated amount, which may vary among merchants and change from time to time. Because authorization is based on this designated amount (not the amount of your intended purchase), authorization may be declined even though the available balance in your Deposit Account is sufficient to cover your intended purchase. To avoid authorizations that may exceed the amount of your intended purchase, you may pay inside the station rather than at the pump. If we authorize a Card transaction, the POS hold will be for the amount requested by the merchant, which may be in excess of the amount of the actual transaction or the amount permitted by the Visa rules. Because each POS hold reduces the available balance in your Deposit Account, any authorization request by a merchant for an amount that exceeds the amount of the actual transaction may cause you to have insufficient funds to pay items posted to your Deposit Account.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that you will not use your Card for any transaction that is illegal in the jurisdiction where you reside, in the jurisdiction where the transaction is consummated, or in any other jurisdiction affected by the transaction. You agree that it is your responsibility to determine the legality of each transaction in all applicable jurisdictions before entering into such transaction. Display of the Visa logo or any other logo by any person accepting the Card does not indicate that the transaction is legal in all applicable jurisdictions. You acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to monitor, to review or to evaluate the legality of your Card transactions. You also agree that you will not use your Card in connection with any Internet or online gambling transaction or lottery ticket purchase, whether or not the same is legal in any applicable jurisdiction. We may refuse to process any Card transaction that we believe may violate the terms of this Agreement, your Deposit Account agreement or applicable law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to pay for any Card transaction that you authorized, even if that transaction is determined to be illegal.</span></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> LIMITATIONS ON FREQUENCY AND DOLLAR AMOUNT OF TRANSACTIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For security reasons, we may impose restrictions on your Card that may limit your ability to use your Card. Some restrictions, which are designed to detect and prevent unauthorized use of your Card, cannot be disclosed. In certain cases, because of the limitations imposed by some non-Bank ATMs and in the event of equipment failure or unavailability, you may not be able to withdraw or to access funds.</span></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> FEES FOR USE OF THE CARD</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than the International Service Fee described in the next paragraph, we do not charge any fees for the use or initial issuance of the Card. We will not charge you a fee to use your Card at any in-network ATM, however, operators of other ATMs and cash dispensing devices, their Networks, and merchants may charge you a fee. Some cash dispensing devices appear to be ATMs, but actually may process certain transactions as PIN transactions. If you use your Card multiple times at one of these cash dispensing devices, some transactions may be processed as PIN Transactions and others as ATM Transactions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><strong>International Transactions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; include any transaction that you make using your Card in a foreign currency and any transaction made using your Card outside of the United States of America, even if that transaction is made in U.S. dollars. If you make a transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars, Visa will convert the amount of that transaction into U.S. dollars according to its own currency conversion procedures in effect at that time. The exchange rate used to convert the currency is either a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets on the applicable processing date (which rate may differ from the rate the entity itself receives), or the government mandated exchange rate in effect on the applicable processing date. The exchange rate in effect on the applicable processing date may differ from the exchange rate in effect on the date you used your Card or Account. The amount (in U.S. dollars) of any credit associated with a particular foreign currency transaction is likely to differ from the amount (in U.S. dollars) of the original transaction due to differences in the applicable rates, which may vary daily. VISA may charge you an International Service Fee (sometimes referred to as an &ldquo;</span><strong>ISF</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) equal to one percent (1%) of the U.S. dollar amount of any International Transaction. The International Service Fee will be calculated on the U.S. dollar amount provided to us by Visa and will be charged to the same Account to which the transaction is posted at the same time the International Transaction posts to that Account. The same conversion process and fee may apply if any International Transaction is reversed or credited back to your Account.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> BUSINESS DAYS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our business days are Monday through Friday, excluding bank holidays.</span></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REQUIREMENT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time you requested your Card, you opened the deposit account with Bank through [North Loop] to which all POS transactions on your Card would be posted, and this deposit account is referred to as your primary Deposit Account. If your primary Deposit Account is closed, you will lose access to your Account and your Card will no longer work. </span></p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> DOCUMENTATION OF TRANSACTIONS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each time you use your Card, you will receive or be given the option to obtain a receipt for that transaction. You also will receive or we will make available to you a periodic account statement, which will show you the details of all transactions and transfers made with your Card during the covered period.</span></p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong> YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRANSACTIONS USING THE CARD</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject to the limitations described in Section 12 below, you agree that you are responsible for all transactions using the Card.</span></p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong> YOUR CARD OR PIN IS LOST, STOLEN OR SUBJECT TO ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to notify us immediately if your Card or PIN is lost or stolen, or if you believe either your Card, PIN, or the account number for your Card is subject to any unauthorized use. You also agree to take any reasonable actions we may request to prevent unauthorized Card use. Contact customer service IMMEDIATELY if a you believe: (a) a Card has been lost or stolen, (b) someone has gained unauthorized access to any access information for your Deposit Account, or (c) someone has transferred or may transfer funds from the Card without your permission. Reporting a lost/stolen Card or unauthorized transactions through +1 (415) 993-4301, by logging into the Website to deactivate the Card is the best way to minimize possible losses or sending an email to help@synapsefi.com. &nbsp;Telephoning is the best way to keep your possible losses down.</span></p>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong> YOUR LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS USING THE CARD, PIN, OR CARD ACCOUNT NUMBER</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us </span><strong>immediately</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you believe that your Card has been lost, stolen or subject to unauthorized use, as provided in Section 11 above. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You can lose all the money in your Deposit Account.</span></p>
<p><strong>For Unauthorized ATM and PIN Transactions.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you believe your Card has been lost, stolen or subject to unauthorized use, and you tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Card and PIN without your permission. For these transactions, if you DO NOT tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss, theft or unauthorized use, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Card if you had told us in time, you could lose as much as $500. If you are a California resident, you will not be liable for the $500 amount described in the prior sentence; however, if you fail to report an unauthorized use that appears on a periodic statement within 60 days of our transmittal or making available your periodic statement to you, then you may be liable for the amount of each unauthorized transfer that occurs after the close of the 60 days and before you provide notice to us, unless the delay in notifying us was due to extenuating circumstances beyond your reasonable control.</span></p>
<p><strong>For Unauthorized Visa Transactions.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the unauthorized transaction was a Visa transaction, we agree to extend the benefits provided by the Visa Zero Liability program in effect at the time of the unauthorized use, as long as you notify us within a reasonable period of time after the loss or theft of your Card or any unauthorized use of it. We will determine, in our sole discretion, the reasonableness of any particular period of time based on the circumstances. If your own fraudulent action or gross negligence contributes to the unauthorized use of your Card for a Visa transaction, then your liability for that use will be determined as provided above in &ldquo;For Unauthorized ATM and PIN transactions.&rdquo; Gross negligence includes but is not limited to your failure to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement, such as your obligations to review your statements and to report any lost or stolen Card or unauthorized use. Also, if your periodic statement shows transfers that you did not make and you DO NOT tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was mailed or made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the sixty (60) day period if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your Card or PIN if you had told us in time. If an extenuating circumstance (such as extended travel or hospitalization) prevents you from promptly notifying us of suspected loss, theft or unauthorized use of your Card, the time periods specified in this paragraph may be extended for a reasonable period.</span></p>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong> OUR LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO MAKE TRANSFERS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Deposit Account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for all your damages proximately caused by such failure. However, there are some exceptions where we will not be liable, including but not limited to the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, through no fault of our own, you do not have enough funds in your Deposit Account to make the transfer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a merchant refuses to accept your Card.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an electronic terminal where you are making a transaction does not operate properly, and you knew about the problem when you initiated the transaction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If access to your Account has been blocked after you reported your Account number lost or stolen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is a hold or your funds are subject to legal or administrative process or other encumbrance restricting their use.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have reason to believe the requested transaction is unauthorized.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, or computer communication failure) prevent the completion of the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the ATM terminal has insufficient cash to complete the transaction.</span></li>
</ul>

<li><strong> VIRTUAL CARD OPTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If enabled by Platform, you may have the option of accessing your Deposit Account with, in addition to your physical card, a virtual card represented by a 16-digit account number (&ldquo;</span><strong>Virtual Card</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). The Virtual Card may either be single-use, meaning the 16-digit account number will expire after a single transaction, or recurring-use, meaning you may use your 16-digit account number for multiple transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may elect to add your Virtual Card to one or more digital wallets (&ldquo;</span><strong>Digital Wallets</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) supported by Bank and subject to the Bank's terms for adding your Virtual Card to a Digital Wallet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Digital Wallet provider may allow you to conduct transactions at a point of sale device and you may not be able to use your Virtual Card to perform transactions at such point of sale devices until you have selected a PIN pursuant to this Agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may use your Virtual Card to make purchases at any merchant that accepts Visa debit cards or debit cards of other networks in which the Bank participates, subject to the funds available in your Deposit Account, the transaction limits described above, and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Each time you use your Virtual Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in your Deposit Account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You are not allowed to exceed the amount of available funds in your Deposit Account through an individual transaction or a series of transactions. If you do not have enough funds available in your Deposit Account, you can instruct the merchant to charge a part of the purchase to the Virtual Card and pay the remaining amount using another payment method. These are called &ldquo;split transactions.&rdquo; Some merchants do not allow cardholders to conduct split transactions. Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the amount of available funds in your Deposit Account, you will be fully liable to us for the full amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. Except for Virtual Cards added to any Digital Wallet, in accordance with and subject to the Digital Wallet Terms, You will not receive a PIN with your Virtual Card or set a PIN for your Virtual Card. When making purchases with your Virtual Card at any POS device other than through a Digital Wallet provider, you may select &ldquo;CREDIT&rdquo; on the keypad to make a signature purchase. You may not use your Virtual Card for online gambling or illegal transactions. We may temporarily &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; your Deposit Account and attempt to contact you if we notice transactions that are unusual or appear suspicious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not use your Virtual Card to obtain cash anywhere.</span></p>
